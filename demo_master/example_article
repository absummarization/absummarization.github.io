National cabinet has set vaccine coverage thresholds of 70 and 80 per cent to reduce the chances of lockdowns and move towards more normal settings.

Mr Morrison said the focus would shift to hospitalisation numbers rather than daily cases when immunisation targets are hit.

"That is our goal - to live with this virus, not to live in fear of it," he told reporters in Canberra on Monday.

Consensus has frayed with Western Australia not budging from its zero-case goal and Queensland warning it may not reopen its NSW border even at the higher threshold.

Updated Doherty Institute modelling will be presented to a national cabinet meeting of the country's leaders on Friday.

Mr Morrison said heavy restrictions, which are affecting more than half of Australia's population across Victoria, NSW and the ACT, could not go on forever.

"It is always darkest before the dawn and I think these lockdowns are demonstration of that," he said.

"But the dawn is not far away. We should not delay it, we should prepare for it. We should not fear it, we should embrace it and we should move forward together."
